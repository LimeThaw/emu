 ## Overview
 
 RAHT stands for Random Access Hash Table, while random access is understood here, that this datastructure can output a random entry efficiently.

 Every entry is stored inside the `data` array. The entries of the `table` dictionary serve as pointers to locate a given entry in `data` through its `hashValue`.
 This configuration enables the relocation of elements in `data` and the arbitrary assignment of a location in `data` for elements.
 The density is defined by the number of elements in the collection (`count`) divided by the size (currently available slots) of `data`. An empty `data` has a density of 1.

 When inserting an element, a random (empty) slot in `data` is searched and the element is inserted there.
 If the density is above 0.7, the element is appended to the end of `data`.
 After insertion in `data` a entry is added to `table` which maps the elements `hashValue` to its location in `data`.

 When deleting an element, the according element is searched in `data` via its entry in `table`. Both entries, the one in `data` and the one in `table` are removed. Afterwards a shrink operation is executed that works as follows:
 When the density is below 0.3 and the uppermost entry of `data` is occupied, this entry is moved to a random other location in `data`. Afterwards the uppermost (empty) slots are removed, until one is occupied, or the density reaches 0.5.
 The shrink operation assures, that the density is never below 0.3 and therefore there is a low number of expected iterations until an element is found in `table` during random access.
 A random access selects a random index above or equal to 0 and below `data`'s size and checks whether the entry in `data` is occupied. If yes, the entry is returned, otherwise this procedure is repeated.
